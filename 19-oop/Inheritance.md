# Inheritance

- When the child class is inheriting properties from parent class.
- Child class = properties of parent class + unique properties of child class
- `extends` allows child class to inherit variables from parent class.

#### Constructors
- A constructor in Java isÂ **a special method that is used to initialize objects**. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes. In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method.

- The type of the reference variable (not the object), that actually detemines what variables can be accessed.
- The parent class cannot access variables in child class.

```ad-important
Here the object itself is of parent class and it is not possible to call the constructor of parent class.
```

##### Super keyword

- `super` keyword calls the parent class constructor directly above.
- In Inheritance, variable of parent class has to be initialised first, before the child variables are initialised. Therefore, `super` keyword has to be used first.
````ad-success
```java
super(l, h, w);  
this.weight = weight;
```
````

````ad-error
```java  
this.weight = weight;
super(l, h, w);
```
````
- `super` can be used instead of `this`, it directly accesses the variable at parent class.
````ad-success
```java
System.out.println(this.w);  
System.out.println(super.w); 
```
````

- While creating constructor, making a copy of the child class,
  `super(child_class_object)` calls the `parent(patent_class_object)` (like typecasting float -> integer)

````ad-success
```java
BoxWeight(BoxWeight other) {  
        super(other);  
        // Box(Box old) {} constructor is used in parent class
	   // Similar to Box box6 = new BoxWeight(1, 2, 3, 4);        
        weight = other.weight;  
    }
```

## Types of Inheritance

1. **Simple Inheritance**:
   One class extends another class.
   
2. **Multi Inheritance**:
   One class extends more than one class. 
   
3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**:
   One class is inherited from many class.
   
4. **Hybrid Inheritance**:
   Both Multi and Hierarchical Inheritance.
